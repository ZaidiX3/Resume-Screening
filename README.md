# Resume-Screening
Recruiters receive a large number of resumes for each job opening, making manual screening time-consuming and inefficient. This project automates resume screening using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to rank candidates based on skills, experience, and qualifications.
The system extracts text from resumes, processes the data, and applies Scikit-learn models to classify and rank candidates. It is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
